Users can create processes, like logging in to thier app, that this app then automates and sets on repeat.  This allows developers to keep an eye on precise processes and be alerted should anything go down.",

As a child my mother always had a garden but I was always too busy running around playing to pay much attention to her technique.  As an adult I decided I wanted to have a small garden too but found it quite overwhellming when looking through online garden resources.  I decided to create a solution.  I removed the verbosity of the usual gardening almanac opting to fill my library with only the basics one needs to get started.  Then I added a click and drag space planner to help determine what one can plant in their available space. This way, one can get gardening easier, faster, and educated.",
