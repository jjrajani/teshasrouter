As an adult I decided I wanted to have a small garden too but found it quite overwhellming when looking through online garden resources.  I decided to create a solution.  I removed the verbosity of the usual gardening almanac opting to fill my library with only the basics one needs to get started.  Then I added a click and drag space planner to help determine what one can plant in their available space. This way, one can get gardening easier, faster, and educated.",
